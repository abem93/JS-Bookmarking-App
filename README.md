# Challenges
  - The very first challenge I encountered was the my background image was not loading at all. It took me quite a while to realize what had happened. It was a few semicolons and curly braces that werents suppose to be there.
  - Had trouble getting the url/api to work had to adjust the way my code parsed all the information together.
